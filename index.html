            I realized that my picture will not show up and only my alt text. I therefore elected to add 
            a static image. Please forgive the fact it was changed after the deadline.-->

        <p><b>Hi there!</b>  

            My name is Crawford Hovis, and I am a Dartmouth '25 excited about the possibility of 
            working in working in the DALI Lab. I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee, so I'm still adjusting to Hanover weather, but spring 
            is getting to be beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm majoring in Computer Science and Economics, and I would love to put the skills that 
            I have learned in COSC 10, 50, and maybe even 51 to good use in the DALI Lab. I look 
            forward to learning more about Web Development an UI/UX design. I love problem solving, 
            which is my favorite part of software development, and I look forward to hopefully putting 
            some of these problem solving skills to more practical, real world use through DALI projects 
            this fall!
        </p>
        <p>
            Something interesting about me is that I am next level at Wii Tennis. Hope to see you all in the fall!
